# Python Starter Repo

## Part 1: 
Go to https://food.grab.com/ph/en/ and enter any place in Manila. The website will display a number of restaurants around the given location

## Part 2:
Scroll down and click "Load More" when you see one. There would need to be clicked many such "Load More" buttons if you want to see all the restaurants

## Part 3:
The project fetches and gives the latitudes and longitudes of all the restaurants on the page

## What is Grab?
Grab is the Swiggy of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines etc. To access it on your browser.

## Note
Do note that we need the latitudes and latitudes of ALL restaurants - which should be more than hundred on one page (in a city like Manila, Philippines).
Project is for educational purposes. There is no intention to overload the GRAB Servers
